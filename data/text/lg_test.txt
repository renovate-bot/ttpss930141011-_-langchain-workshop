Today is 5/18. I went to take out my wisdom teeth yesterday. Until now , it is been more than 24 hours. It have so much of pain last night that I had to take painkillers. Although now it is fine than last night, it still keep a bit pain. If I have to describe the pain of taking out the wisdom teeth as a 1~100 number, it must be PI, a endless, continous number.
My gf have a cute round face. Sometimes I joked her face look like a dog which stung by bees, when she chewed something. Like the following photo:
  
But now my face is swollen bigger than the dog. Oh god, I will not joke my gf’s face anymore, please let my face become normal!
 
Today is 5/20. It had poured outside since last night. Finally, it stoped to rain in this morning. Then I saw a news which reported about there was a underpass flooded by rainwater. When I took a closer look, I found that is a underpass beside by house. I am used to pass through it to take a train!
  
Because the news caught my eyes, I clicked in the comment area. Most of the people were criticizing the new mayor like ‘she sucks’, ‘she just can to dig the baseball field’. I have to say I won’t blame these people because they do have right to leave the comment. But I really hate the news media in Taiwan — maybe that is my hatest thing in Taiwan. In fact, this underpass would have been flooded by rain when pouring a decade earlier.
There are two worst things in Taiwan news media, first is the news media in Taiwan have fully politically charged. I can’t even see any neutal news media. ‘BIG LOVE TV’ might be, but that was ten years ago.
Second is news media always bring some partial infomation in the news. The title of the news always so eye-catching just for raising the disscussion. Sometimes I really suspect that have the reporter really search the truth deeply? It is really often we see somebody hurt by news. But at the time that guy explain his innocence. Who really care? All in all, it must have something wrong with press in Taiwan , but this time I want to take out of context in today’s diary like our reporter friends — ‘If you put down your pens and books when you were young, you must have a talent to be a reporter!’
